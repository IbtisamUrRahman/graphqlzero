# [GraphQLZero](https://graphqlzero.almansi.me): A simple, zero-config fake GraphQL API

GraphQLZero is a free, online GraphQL API that you can use to get fake data from a real backend while testing or prototyping your app. It is inspired and powered by JSONPlaceholder, serving the same dataset but in the form of a GraphQL server. You'll find it useful for learning more about GraphQL, writing tutorials, testing new libraries, and more.
